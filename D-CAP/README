1. Content of the Package

The gCAP package contains following main codes:

  cap.c		Generalized Cut-and-Paste (gCAP) full moment-tensor inversion code.

  cap.pl	A Perl script to simplify the use of gCAP and to plot waveform fits.

  depth.pl	A perl script to read in the outputs of gCAP for different
		source depths and estimate the best source depth.

  mtdcmp.f	A Fortran code to decompose a general moment tensor into ISO, DC
		and CLVD tensors, and to compute the ISO and CLVD parameters.

  radpttn.c	A C code to compute the normalized moment tensor components
		from strike dip rake iso clvd and the P/SV/SH radiation pattern.


2. Installation

To compile the codes see Makefile. It requires that the Numerical Recipes
Package and SAC have been installed. Set environment variables NR_HOME and
SAC_HOME to point to where they are installed accordingly.


3. Usage

For usage and examples, run cap.pl without argument.

5. Revision History

   1995-2008		LZ	Numerious modifications.
   Mar. 11, 2010 	LZ	Correct a bug when computing Mw using interpolation.
                                Change to no interpolation of FM untill the correct
				Mw is found to aoid unstable interpolation in some cases.
   Mar. 12, 2010	LZ	Add isotropic component in the inversion.
   June 10, 2010	LZ	Correct a bug introduced in Jan. 2008 which deleted
				distance compensation and Pnl weighting of the
				Greens functions.
   Nov.  5, 2012	LZ	Add CLVD component. Add bootstrapping option.
   Mar.  5, 2013	LZ	Change the CLVD parameter to sqrt(3/2)*lambda2.
				depth.pl now plots beach ball of full moment tensor.
